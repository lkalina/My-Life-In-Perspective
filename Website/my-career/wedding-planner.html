      <p>Every Summer I work with a Event Planning company called Completely Yours. This company has shown me how exciting but also stressful event planning actually is. Over the Summers i have fallen in love with the whole weddding process, from begining to end. Everything from harrassing vendors and DJs to on site detail preparations. At the end of the day i know all the work and effort i put in is worth it because i get to be part of someoones special day, that they will remember forever. The best part of being an event planner is being able to sit back and watch all your preparations and hard effort come together to make one magical day. </p>
