      <h1>My Biography</h1>
      <p>Hi my name is Lauren Kalina, I am currently a student at Manhattan College. My family and i love to travel and have travled and lived all over the world. I am currently double majoring in Advertising and Philosophy. I hope to some day work in health care advertising and eventually move to higher education teaching philosophy. </p>
      <p>Let's face it, I don't live the life of a rock-star or famous athlete ... but those guys are always getting caught cheating on their wives, so why would I want to live that life?<br>
        <br>
        It sure would make writing this more entertaining, and reading it would be much more fun too. I could tell you about all the exotic cities and expensive hotels I've stayed at while being on tour. All the parties, clubs, alcohol and drugs ... it would make for a much more interesting read.<br>
        <br>
        Maybe the rock-star lifestyle would be fun, but I don't want to live that life and a girl that's looking for that is not for me. While my story might be Rolling Stone worthy, I do work hard, pay my bills, enjoy the company of my friends &amp; family ... while enjoying myself like I was a rock-star on tour.<br>
        <br>
        Family and friends are most important to me in life. I've learned that money and opportunities come and go, but your friends and family are always there to help you when you need it. I hope one day I can pass down those qualities to a family of my own, and it's why I work so hard today.<br>
        <br>
        I fully don't expect you to message me, I guess if I was getting 20 or 30 messages a day from people I wouldn't have to. Unfortunately real, honest guys like me often get passed over because we don't stand out among the hundreds on here trying to find a date by auto-blasting e-mails they have stored up on a hard drive. But if you're one of the few that are reading this to actually meet someone you like, here are some of the things that make me unique;<br>
        <br>
        <strong>[Activity]Â </strong><br>
        <strong>[Activity]</strong><br>
        <strong>[Sport]</strong><br>
        <strong>[Job]</strong><br>
        <strong>[An example of you doing something for someone else]</strong><br>
        <strong>[Goal In Life]</strong><br>
        <br>
      That's me in a nutshell. If I contact you, I appreciate you taking the time to read this and would love to get to know you more because most people don't get this far.</p>
